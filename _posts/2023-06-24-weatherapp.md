# A Command-Line Weather Checker Using OpenWeatherMap API 
Weather data is essential for daily activities, from planning events to understanding climate trends. I developed a Command-Line Weather Forecasting Tool that retrieves real-time and future weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. This tool is user-friendly and packed with features to provide valuable weather insights. Let‚Äôs explore its key features and functionality.

The code is available on GitHub: [Weather-Forecast](https://github.com/paulrounak/Weather-Forecast.git).

## Key Features of the Weather Forecasting Tool 
The Weather Forecasting Tool provides users with essential weather data for a given city. Here are the main features that make it practical and user-friendly:
 
1. **Current Weather** 
Get real-time weather data for any city, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy), "feels like" temperature, and more.
 
2. **5-Day Weather Forecast** 
Receive a 5-day weather forecast with detailed hourly updates. This feature helps users plan their day or week with temperature and weather conditions forecasted for each day.
 
3. **Support for Metric and Imperial Units** 
Depending on your preference, the tool supports both **metric**  (Celsius, m/s) and **imperial**  (Fahrenheit, mph) units for temperature and wind speed.
 
4. **Help Documentation** 
The built-in help feature displays all available commands and options, guiding users on how to properly use the tool.
 
5. **Error Handling** 
The tool gracefully handles invalid city names and API errors, providing clear error messages to ensure a smooth user experience.

## How to Use the Weather Forecasting Tool
Using the Weather Forecasting Tool is simple and straightforward. Here‚Äôs how you can get started:
1. **Installation:** To begin, you need to download or clone the repository containing the tool. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paulrounak/Weather-Forecast.git
    ```
2. Once cloned, navigate to the directory where the `weathermap.py` script is located.**2. Running the Script** 
After setting up the repository, you can run the Python script directly from your terminal by passing the name of the city you want to check the weather for:

    ```bash
    python weathermap.py <city_name>
    ```
**Example Usage** :

    - For **current weather**  in **metric units** :

        ```bash
        python weathermap.py -c Hawaii
        ```
 
    - For a **5-day forecast**  in **imperial units** :

        ```bash
        python weathermap.py -F Hawaii
        ```
3. **Help Command:** If you're not sure about the available options, you can use the `-h` flag to get a quick help message with the usage syntax:

    ```bash
    python weathermap.py -h
    ```

This will display the available options, such as:
 
- `-c`: Get current weather in metric units.
 
- `-f`: Get a 5-day forecast in metric units.
 
- `-C`: Get current weather in imperial units.
 
- `-F`: Get a 5-day forecast in imperial units.
 
- `-h`: Display help documentation.

## Understanding the Code

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how the tool works behind the scenes:

**Validating User Input:** 

The tool validates the command-line arguments to ensure the user has provided valid input. If there are errors, such as an invalid city name or incorrect options, it displays the help message and exits gracefully.

**Fetching Weather Data:** 

The tool uses the **OpenWeatherMap API**  to fetch weather data for the specified city. Based on the user's options, it constructs a URL that either retrieves current weather or a 5-day forecast, using the appropriate units (metric or imperial).

**Parsing the Data:** 

Once the weather data is fetched, the script parses the returned JSON response and displays relevant weather information in a readable format. If the option is for a 5-day forecast, it organizes the data by date and time.

**Error Handling:** 

The tool checks for errors, such as when the specified city is not found in the OpenWeatherMap database. In such cases, an error message is displayed, and the program exits without crashing.

## GitHub Copilot: How It Helped in Development
Throughout the development of the tool, I used **GitHub Copilot**  to streamline the process. Here‚Äôs how Copilot made a difference: 
- **Code Generation from Comments** : By writing comments describing the functionality I wanted, GitHub Copilot generated the corresponding code, saving time and improving productivity.
 
- **Code Optimization** : Copilot suggested more efficient ways of writing code, helping me improve performance and readability.
 
- **Auto-Suggestions for Functions** : Copilot offered suggestions for Python functions and libraries, reducing the need to manually search for syntax.
 
- **Documentation Generation** : Copilot assisted in creating comments and documentation, making it easy to explain the tool‚Äôs functionality and usage.

## Installation and Setup
To set up the Weather Forecasting Tool, follow these simple steps:
 
1. **Clone the Repository** :

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paulrounak/Weather-Forecast.git
    ```
 
2. **Navigate to the Script Directory** :

    ```bash
    cd Weather-Forecast
    ```
 
3. **Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API Key** :
To access the weather data, you‚Äôll need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) . After obtaining the key, replace the placeholder key in the script with your own.
 
4. **Run the Script** :

    ```bash
    python weathermap.py <city_name>
    ```

## Conclusion
The Weather Forecasting Tool is an easy-to-use command-line application that helps you quickly check the weather for any city, with support for both current conditions and 5-day forecasts. It also offers flexibility in units (metric and imperial), handles errors gracefully, and includes an informative help section for ease of use.
This project showcases the power of **Python** , **APIs** , and how tools like **GitHub Copilot**  can enhance productivity and improve code quality. Whether you're a beginner or a developer looking to add weather data functionality to your projects, this tool is a great starting point.
